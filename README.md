PROBLEM:
What is architecture? Architecture is the art or practice of designing and constructing buildings.
tBP/Architecture is more than just about buildings. tBP/Architecture is a full-service architectural practice
specializing in facilities planning and design for educational and public sector facilities in California.

The firm seeks to enhance their brand with a design focused,  yet highly functional, website that showcases
their buildings and works. A site map consisting of various pages including Home, About, News, Projects, and Contact.

ACTION:
To prototype the website, Material Bootstrap was used to quickly create the layout of the website following the site map.
The website follows a mobile-first design scheme, focusing on responsive design. The images are scaled according to the
width of the container.

SOLUTION:
The main slider of the Home page showcases featured projects by the firm. Headers following the core values of the firm are
displayed with clean, bold, and easy to read fonts. The About page features a stylistic display of images and text.
A short description of the firm is displayed. The Team section features a flip-card animation showing an image, name,
title, and a short About Me section when the card is flipped.

Description:
Material Bootstrap theme for tBP/Architecture firm.
